1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?
Some commands you can use are cd, which moves you to a directory within your computer, clear to clear your terminal workspace, or ls to show what is within a certain directory. 


2. Do you have pets? What kind?
I have a 13 year old dog, 6 turtles, 3 fish, and and axolotl named Cookie! (not too sure if those are legal to own in california though)


3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
You should see if it specifies where in your code there is an issue cuh as an "unexpected term" or when a "directory does not exist" to identify what you might have to change. 


4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
My friend took a half a piece of bread from lunch and attached it to a keychain on her backpack and wore it on her lanyard for the rest of the day. 


5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
A Python script is a file that contains code that you can run in your command line. An example is the way all python scripts are contained within .py files!
